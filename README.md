## Usage
The source is preconfigured to use the official server, if you feel like hosting your own instance, clone `simple-chat-graphql-server` and `yarn && yarn start` it. For regular usage, a precompiled APK is available in the Releases tab.

## Features
SimpleChat has many features that are similar to Discord's, chatting, server creation and sharing, etc. 

## Roadmap
The next step right now is to develop a web version and to improve the stability of the app.
The plan is to make a fully functional chat app, complete with voice-chat, video-sharing and many other features.

## Contributing
Contributions are most welcome, as well as suggestions and criticism. Open an issue, let's chat!

## Technologies used

Plus many others for the [backend server](https://github.com/ianeli1/simple-chat-graphql-server)
